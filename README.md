# swiftDialog-Jamf-Protect-Template
## A simple way to put all of your remediations in one script!

One of the coolest features of Jamf Protect is the ability to partner with Jamf Pro for remediation. The way this is accomplished is through smart groups and policies that are scoped to machines that have a Jamf Protect EA tied to them.

A cool project out there is from @bartreardon: swiftDialog. The goal of this script was to make a simple template that would notify end-users of potential threats and remediation progress.

This is my first experience using swiftDialog and it is a really sweet project. Hope this is a helpful resource for Mac Admins! 

Let me know if you have any feedback!

(The script will check to see if swiftDialog is installed, if not it will install it for you.)
